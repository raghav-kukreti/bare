# Logline

Two ancestral artforms survive through the veneration of Hanuman, a hindu deity with a monkey face and human body. This is the story of being held on a leash to the hands of faith, heritage and poverty that explores the concept of humanism and divinity.

# Synopsis

Dalip is a monkey charmer who belongs to a small community of 'Madaris', an ancestral occupation of training monkeys to act like humans. Eleven year old Rohit belongs to a community of 'Behrupiyas', traditional impressionist who train their kids to act like apes. Both these fringe communities survive under abject poverty, tied firmly to the belief of a hindu mythological deity 'Hanuman: Half monkey-half human', a symbol of selfess devotion and strength. Both convene to perform at Hanuman temple. In a role reversal battle between animal as human and human as animal, who would come out triumphant?

*Or is there really a triumph?*

# Concept

The film will draw parallels between the life of a captured monkey family, 20 year old Dharmendra, his 15 year old mate Hema and their offspring Isha. They all travel from place to place with their human master Daleep. These animals dress up and perform actions like humans for public amusement. Amidst all the frolic lies the true reality of how they are being mistreated and trained. Their teeth are taken out, they are starved out and are kept in an pathetic state in a flies and mosquito infested area, tied to a rusted iron leash.

On the other hand, we follow a child from the Behrupiya (impressionist) community who dresses up like a monkey and mimics the animal for public entertainment. The impressionist community is in a dire state of being, safeguarding a thousand year old artform. The community suffers with the lack of education and the coming generation is forced to be in the state of poverty due to lack of an alternate skill. Without a proper rehabilitation, they would continue to be in the chains of poverty.

# Director's Statement

*God on a leash* is a short documentary that was shot in my hometown of New Delhi. I was acquainted to this cultural practice at a very young age and through this documentary, I am finally able to unravel the intricacies of this culture.

We followed a Madari, who sat with his macaques and their o spring near a Hanuman temple at North Campus. It seemed the babyâ€™s future in chains was indomitable, much like the o springs of the ancestral impressionists community. It created a cruel euphemism about our ignorance, the way we choose to live our lives, follow our traditions and practice our faith.
The film is a window to a highly embellished niche world with a contrastingly unembellished human experience.
